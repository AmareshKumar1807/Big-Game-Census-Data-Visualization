Power BI Project: Task 2

Super Bowl Players & Geographic Trends Analysis üèàüìä


I will talk about a recent project I worked on analyzing data using Power BI to gain insight into the profile of Super Bowl players and their geographic origins. It combines sports analytics with US Census data by providing an out-of-the-box view into the hometowns of top football athletes.
üîç Project Overview
I worked with a dataset that included:
Full profiles of the players participating in the Super Bowl, including height, weight, matches played, years in the league.
Detailed birthplace information, including latitude and longitude coordinates to map the locations from which the players originated.
Population estimates for each player's hometown (U.S. Census Bureau 2010-2017).
By integrating this information, I was able to observe the following relationships:
The number of players produced by each city.
The trends of the population of those cities over time.
üîë Key Visualizations
Clustered Column Chart: A chart that compares the number of Super Bowl players from each city to its population estimates, in order to figure out which cities are punching above their weight in producing professional athletes.
Player Profiles with Slicer: I utilized a dynamic slicer, which allows users to click on a player's name and view their full profile (height, weight, matches played, and years played). This enables a clean way of interacting with individual player data.
üîç Findings & Insights
Player Production vs. City Population: Cities with smaller populations, like several towns from Texas and Alabama, consistently had a surprisingly large number of Super Bowl players, possibly indicating strong local football culture and advanced training infrastructures.
Geographic Concentrations: Specific regions, like the Southern U.S. and California, dominate in producing football talent. These regions correspond to high levels of football training programs and athlete output.
Trends Over Time: In some cases, the growth of hometown populations coincided with the appearance of big-name athletes. Sports success might boost a city‚Äôs local visibility, though further research is needed to confirm this.
üèÜ Conclusions
This project highlights interesting patterns in how geographic and demographic factors may influence the production of elite athletes. Merging sports data with census data provided meaningful insights on talent scouting, city-based football programs, and even marketing opportunities for brands tapping into football's regional powerhouses.
üåê Technologies Used: Power BI for data visualization and interactivity, with data integration from sports analytics and U.S. Census population estimates. If you're into data-driven sports insights or want to discuss Power BI techniques, feel free to connect!
